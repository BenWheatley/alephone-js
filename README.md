# Goals with this fork

I would like to learn several things:

* Old-school first-person game engines
* JavaScript
* Modern-ish GLSL
* AI based software development

So I'm planning to combine all ~~three~~ four by converting this into JavaScript.

As for why Marathon: we have DOOM on enough platforms already, why not give the 90s Mac equivalent some love?
